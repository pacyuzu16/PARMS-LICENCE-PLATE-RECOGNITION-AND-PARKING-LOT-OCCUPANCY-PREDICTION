  AUC:       0.9565

Cross-Validation:
  Mean F1:   0.8830 ± 0.0025

Top 5 Features:
  1. image_occupancy_rate: 0.4850
  2. image_occupancy_rate_scaled: 0.3352
  3. bbox_y: 0.0387
  4. bbox_y_scaled: 0.0377

Note: Each sample represents one parking space (bounding box) from the images.
The model predicts occupancy for individual parking spaces, not entire images.
